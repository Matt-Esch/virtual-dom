# Custom Patching and Rendering
The [patch](../vdom/patch.js) function takes a DOM node `rootNode`, a list of patches `patches` (typically generated by [diff](../vtree/diff.js)), and an options object `renderOptions`, and is then responsible for making the actual changes to the DOM.

## Custom patchRecursive Function
By default, virtual-dom uses the `patchRecursive` function found in [vdom/patch](../vdom/patch.js) to loop through each patch and decide what to do with it. If you would like to control this yourself, you can give a function to `renderOptions.patch` and it will take over. You'll also want to look at [patch-op](../vdom/patch-op.js), as it is in charge of looking at each patch and deciding how to treat it based on what type it is. 

## Custom createElement Function
You can also override the behavior of [create-element](../vdom/create-element.js), which is used as a default in some patch operations by giving a function to `renderOptions.render`. In most cases, this is the function responsible for actually turning the new virtual element into a real DOM element. Read the [patch-op](../vdom/patch-op.js) code to see when this function gets applied.
